ExtjsD3Charts
=============

If you are into data visualization and developing in JavaScript then you have probably heard of d3js which can be found at d3js.org, you may not have heard about NVD3 which is a nice open source group of reusable charts based on d3js created by developers for the financial industry. You can find NVD3 here http://nvd3.org/ . What these two chart packages do is allow you, the developer, to control every last pixel on the screen. You are also left with code that can be moved away from Extjs if that day comes. Just take a look at the examples page to realize how many possibilities there are when it comes to charting: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery. I needed to get that type of flexibility in my application and I liked the crisp sharp lines so I went ahead and threw together some NVD3 / D3 based widgets that you can use in your applications by simply adding them and referencing the xtype. I am assuming that you will be using extjs 5 so the instructions here are for installation in an extjs5 application â€“ that said they should work with extjs4 as well.
